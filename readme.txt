== Description ==

The plugin also lets you present customer ratings in form of Review Rating Bar Graph. 

Before buying a product online, most people prefer reading its reviews from those who have used the product. This helps the prospects in gaining idea about how worthy the product actually is and whether or not it would suitable for them to buy.
Therefore, reading reviews is something most online customers inevitably do before buying any product. 
For those who are too lazy to read the reviews (and for others too!), product ratings often form a major criterion for eliminating or short listing a product. Therefore, for online shops, having a review section is a must. Reviews assist your customers in purchase decision making.

Advance Reviews For Woocommerce lets you put your customer reviews and ratings on a product page. Not just that, it also lets you visually present customer ratings in form of Review Rating Bar Graph.
